This is a log of everything I have learnt about recruiting software developers. Each part of this is process (job description, application and comms, interview, tech screen etc) are really closely related, and each represent points where a talented engineer may drop out of the process. Contrast the experience of dealing with a company that is organised, warm and complimentary vs. a company that is disorganised, takes ages to get back to you and the interview feels more like an interrogation.

If you speak to a company and they seem disorganised and a bit rude

# The Golden Rule

It's about them, not you!

# The Job Description

Hiring for diversity:

# The Initial Interview

## Before the interview

- read the CV. Don't skim!

## During the interview

- BE ON TIME - unless something drastic has happened, like a family member being taken ill or you've been made a hostage, there is no excuse for this.
- give an introduction of how long it will take and what we will talk about. 
- asking a candidate to go over their CV is not a good use of time.
- remember to let them talk/don't cut them off.

### Possile questions:

- What was the trigger that got you into software engineering?

# Technical Screen

- must be relevant to the job!
- set them at ease. If it's a hard technnical problem and you're not expecting a perfect solution, but an idea of how they approach the problem, say that.
