# Meetings

## Give credit and encouragement first

When someone demos work, they have put effort into it and tried to deliver useful work. It creates a context of negativity if the first comments after their demo is to pick a fault.

## Don't just pick holes

Deliver criticial feedback in a way that you would like to receive it. Practice expressing a different opinion on a technical aspect as part of a polite discussion.

## Webcam on

Having the camera on allows a much closer connection. Whilst not essential, it generally gives a more "connnected" experience.

## Don't interupt or talk over someone

This is really disrespectful and creates a bad experience. 

## "At my last place..."

If you have a suggestion that you have seen used successfully before, by all means share it. If you are just keen to remind people of your experience, it becomes tiresome very quickly. 

## Always finish on time

Overrunning meetings are a symptom of poor planning and inconsiderate to the other time committments of those attending the meeting.

## Be mindful of location

Less of a problem now more people are remote, but having a remote meeting where there are some people together in a room discussing stuff "off mic" is unhelpful/rude.
