## Quiet times

Software development is all about having the functionality running in your headspace. This takes a lot of time and concentration to read the code and think about how data flows around. If you've got that all up and running, and then you get a "PING!" every hour or so from an `@here` on Slack to announce company news, it's hard to maintain that concentration, and you'll likely lose your train of thought. As a developer, you deliver value when you are concentrating on code and adding to it. Companies that appreciate this and want to maximise effectivceness will designate times when people don't bombard you with information that is not time-sensitive that can wait until the end of the day. You're paid to produce work - without this understanding, _AT A COMPANY LEVEL_, your concentration is always going to be vulernale.

I find I hit a great work cadence at 2:45 - 4:45, if you ping an @here during that time, it destorys that.

One solution to this is to mute particular channels on Slack, but understanding companies should not need this. 

## Social channels

## In person meet ups


# Meetings

## Webcam on

Having the camera on allows a much closer connection. Whilst not essential, it generally gives a more "connnected" experience.

## Give credit and encouragement first

When someone demos work, they have put effort into it and tried to deliver useful work. It creates a context of negativity if the first comments after their demo is to pick a fault.

## Don't just pick holes

Deliver criticial feedback in a way that you would like to receive it. 

## Don't interupt

## "At my last place..."

If you have a suggestion that you have seen used successfully before, by all means share it. However if you are just keen to remind people where you have come from, it becomes tiresome very quickly. 

## Always finish on time

Overrunning meetings are a symptom of poor planning and inconsiderate to the other time committments of those attending the meeting.

## Be mindful of location

Less of a problem now more people are remote, but having a remote meeting where there are some people together in a room discussing stuff "off mic" is unhelpful/rude.


# Package

## Adaquete Holiday allowance

The pandemic has given us all a sense of unease over the last year and a half, and that is exhausting. Only having the bare legal allowance for holiday means that you're unlikely to have found time and space to recover from that anxiety. Considerate employers have dedicated additional time off for this.


# Remote Workspace

## Quietest place in the house

## Desks/chairs

## Lighting/webcam

## Home office budget

## Understanding Family

It took me a long time to persuade my wife to leave me alone when working from home. She works Tuesday - Saturday, so on MOnday's she would typically lay in until 10 seconds before my turn at the morning stand up and then disrupt me. Every. Single. Week. I would say to her "I'm about to start my morning call!", and get "OK!" back. What I really meant was "DON'T YOU DARE DISRUPT ME AGAIN!". Then one day, her parents stayed over and guess what time they all descending on the room I was working from?! It took her dad to tell her that work like this requirements
